# 🚀 DevOps Journey – Sachin Shekhar Bashetti

This repository documents my **hands-on DevOps learning journey**, combining structured study with practical implementation.
It includes notes, commands, experiments, and summaries from real work on **CI/CD, containers, Kubernetes, and GitOps**.

The goal is not just to collect notes, but to **understand systems end to end** and build habits used in real DevOps roles.
