# Kubernetes Deployment – End-to-End Example

This folder contains a complete example of:
- Containerizing an application
- Pushing image to DockerHub
- Deploying using Kubernetes Deployment
- Performing rollout, history, and rollback

This represents a **real application deployment workflow**,
not just a concept demo.
