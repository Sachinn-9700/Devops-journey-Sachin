# Docker Fundamentals

This folder explains the **core concepts of Docker** in simple language, from a DevOps learning perspective.

Docker is a tool that helps us package and run applications in a **consistent and isolated environment**, called a container.
This makes applications easy to run on laptops, servers, and cloud platforms without changing the setup.
